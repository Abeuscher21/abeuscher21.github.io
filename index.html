    <h1>Hello! I'm AJ!</h1>
    <div class="bio">
      <p>
        I was born and raised in south-eastern Wisconsin in the small town of Jackson. My real name is Austin, but have always gone by my initials, A.J.<br> 
        Growing up I spent time in the Boyscouts, earning the rank of Life Scout. I also dedicated 17 years to 
        practicing Tae-Kwon-Do and eventually earning the rank of black belt at the age of 14. I was the first person under the age of 18 to earn a 
        black belt at Dukatz Academy of Martial Arts and continued to teach at the school until I moved away to Colorado to pursue higher education. 
        After highschool I became a critcal care paramedic which I have been doing for nearly the last decade, meanwhile earning my Bachelors degree in 
        biomedical science from the fantastic Colorado State University (GO RAMS!). After staying in medicine for as long as I have, I made the decision 
        to shake things up and pursue a career in web development. In my free time when I'm not trying to improve my code, you can find me out climbing rocks, 
        enjoying local coffee shops and breweries with my loving girlfriend Samantha, playing video games, hanging out with my cat Beacher, or watching the Green Bay Packers. <br><br>
        I have always been a devote life-long learner and am excited to keep improving my abilities in code and am looking for a company that I can grow 
        with, and show everything that I am capable of. I am completely self taught and am always looking for new oppurtunies and exciting adventures. Hopefully 
        we can collaborate on something soon! <br>
